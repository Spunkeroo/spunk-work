<h1>How to Write a Resume That Gets Interviews in 2026</h1>
<p style="color:#666">Updated February 27, 2026 &middot; 13 min read</p>

<p>Your resume has 7.4 seconds. That is the average time a recruiter spends on initial screening before deciding to read further or move on. In 2026, your resume also has to pass through AI-powered Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before a human ever sees it. Over 98% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS software to filter resumes.</p>

<p>This guide shows you how to write a resume that beats both the algorithm and the human. No fluff, no filler -- just the strategies that actually lead to interviews.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="format">Choose the Right Format</h2>
<p>There are three resume formats. In 2026, one of them works 90% of the time:</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Reverse-chronological (use this):</strong> Lists your most recent job first and works backward. This is what recruiters expect, what ATS parses best, and what hiring managers prefer. Use this format unless you have a very specific reason not to.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Functional (avoid):</strong> Organizes by skills rather than job history. Recruiters dislike this format because it hides your career timeline. ATS systems also struggle to parse it. Only consider it if you have 5+ year career gaps with no explanation.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Combination (situational):</strong> Leads with a skills summary, then lists experience chronologically. Works for career changers who need to highlight transferable skills while still showing work history.</div>

<h3>Formatting Rules for 2026</h3>
<ul>
<li>One page for less than 10 years of experience, two pages maximum for senior roles</li>
<li>Standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Garamond, or Helvetica at 10-12pt</li>
<li>Margins: 0.5 to 1 inch on all sides</li>
<li>Section headings: bold, slightly larger font, clear hierarchy</li>
<li>Save as PDF unless the job posting specifically requests .docx</li>
<li>File name: FirstName-LastName-Resume.pdf</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contact">Contact Information</h2>
<p>Your contact section should include exactly these elements and nothing more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full name</strong> -- largest text on the page</li>
<li><strong>Phone number</strong> -- one number with a professional voicemail</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> -- professional address (firstname.lastname@gmail.com, not partyguy99@yahoo.com)</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn URL</strong> -- customize it to linkedin.com/in/yourname</li>
<li><strong>City and state</strong> -- full street address is no longer necessary</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio URL</strong> -- if relevant to your field (design, writing, development)</li>
</ul>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Leave off:</strong> Photo (triggers bias concerns in the US), date of birth, marital status, social security number, and full street address. None of these belong on a modern resume.</div>

<h2 id="summary">Professional Summary</h2>
<p>A professional summary is 2-3 sentences at the top of your resume that tell the hiring manager exactly what you bring. It replaces the outdated "objective statement" and should focus on what you deliver, not what you want.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Bad objective:</strong> "Seeking a challenging position where I can utilize my skills and grow professionally." This tells the employer nothing useful about you.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Good summary:</strong> "Marketing manager with 6 years of experience driving B2B SaaS growth. Led demand generation campaigns that increased qualified leads by 340% and reduced cost-per-acquisition by 28%. Skilled in HubSpot, Google Ads, and data-driven content strategy."</div>

<p>The formula is simple: <strong>[Title] with [X years] experience in [specialty]. [Measurable achievement]. [Key skills relevant to the target role].</strong></p>

<h2 id="experience">Work Experience That Stands Out</h2>
<p>Your experience section is the most important part of your resume. Most candidates describe their job duties. Winning candidates describe their <strong>results</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Results Formula</h3>
<p>Every bullet point should follow this structure: <strong>Action verb + what you did + measurable result</strong>.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Weak:</strong> "Responsible for managing social media accounts and creating content."</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Strong:</strong> "Grew Instagram following from 2,400 to 45,000 in 8 months through data-driven content strategy, generating $180K in attributed revenue."</div>

<p>Notice the difference. The weak version describes duties. The strong version proves impact with specific numbers. Hiring managers care about outcomes, not responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Quantify Everything</h3>
<p>Numbers are the most powerful element on a resume. Find ways to quantify every achievement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue generated or saved</li>
<li>Percentage improvements (growth, efficiency, reduction)</li>
<li>Team size managed</li>
<li>Budget controlled</li>
<li>Number of projects completed</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction scores</li>
<li>Time saved through process improvements</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Many Bullets Per Job</h3>
<ul>
<li>Current/most recent role: 4-6 bullet points</li>
<li>Previous roles: 3-4 bullet points</li>
<li>Older roles (5+ years ago): 2-3 bullet points or combine into a summary line</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="skills">Skills Section</h2>
<p>Your skills section serves two purposes: helping ATS match you to the job and giving recruiters a quick snapshot of your capabilities.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>How to build your skills list:</strong> Read the job description and identify every skill mentioned. Include the ones you genuinely have. Add related skills that strengthen your candidacy. Group them by category for easy scanning.</div>

<h3>Skills Section Example</h3>
<p><strong>Technical:</strong> Python, JavaScript, SQL, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Git</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Jira, Confluence, Figma, Slack, Notion, Google Analytics</p>
<p><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Cross-functional leadership, stakeholder communication, agile project management</p>

<p>Do not list basic skills like Microsoft Office or "proficient in email." These are assumed and waste space. List skills that differentiate you.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>Education placement depends on your career stage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recent graduates (0-2 years experience):</strong> Place education above work experience. Include GPA if 3.5+, relevant coursework, and academic achievements.</li>
<li><strong>Experienced professionals (3+ years):</strong> Place education below work experience. Just list degree, institution, and graduation year. GPA and coursework are no longer relevant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Certifications and Continuing Education</h3>
<p>In 2026, certifications often carry more weight than degrees for technical roles. Include relevant certifications with the issuing organization and date. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Solutions Architect -- Amazon Web Services, 2025</li>
<li>Google Analytics 4 Certification -- Google, 2026</li>
<li>PMP -- Project Management Institute, 2024</li>
<li>HubSpot Inbound Marketing -- HubSpot Academy, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ats">ATS Optimization</h2>
<p>Applicant Tracking Systems scan your resume for keywords, parse your information into structured data, and score you against the job description. Here is how to ensure your resume passes:</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 1: Mirror the job description.</strong> If the listing says "project management," use that exact phrase -- not "managing projects." ATS matches exact keywords. Read the job description and naturally incorporate key terms throughout your resume.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 2: Use standard section headings.</strong> ATS systems look for "Experience," "Education," "Skills," and "Summary." Creative headings like "My Journey" or "What I Bring" confuse parsers.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 3: Avoid formatting traps.</strong> Do not use tables, text boxes, headers/footers, images, charts, or multi-column layouts. ATS systems cannot parse these elements and will miss your content entirely.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 4: Use both acronyms and spelled-out versions.</strong> Write "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)" the first time so ATS catches both the full phrase and the acronym.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 5: Test your resume.</strong> Free ATS scanning tools like Jobscan and Resume Worded score your resume against a job description. Aim for a 75%+ match score.</div>

<h2 id="mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typos and grammar errors:</strong> One typo eliminates 77% of resumes according to hiring managers. Proofread three times, then have someone else review it.</li>
<li><strong>Generic resumes:</strong> Sending the same resume to every job. Tailor your summary and skills to each position. It takes 10 minutes and doubles your response rate.</li>
<li><strong>Listing duties instead of results:</strong> "Responsible for..." is the worst way to start a bullet. Lead with action verbs and end with measurable impact.</li>
<li><strong>Including irrelevant experience:</strong> Your high school summer job does not belong on your resume after 5 years of professional experience. Every line should strengthen your candidacy for this specific role.</li>
<li><strong>Passive language:</strong> "Was tasked with" and "helped with" are weak. Use active, specific language: "Led," "Built," "Increased," "Reduced."</li>
<li><strong>Lying:</strong> Background checks catch false claims. Inflated titles, fake degrees, and exaggerated numbers will end your candidacy and potentially your career.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="power-verbs">Power Verbs and Action Words</h2>
<p>Start every bullet point with a strong action verb. Here are the most effective ones by category:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Category</th><th>Power Verbs</th></tr>
<tr><td>Leadership</td><td>Led, Directed, Managed, Oversaw, Coordinated, Mentored</td></tr>
<tr><td>Achievement</td><td>Achieved, Exceeded, Delivered, Earned, Won, Surpassed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Growth</td><td>Grew, Increased, Expanded, Scaled, Accelerated, Doubled</td></tr>
<tr><td>Efficiency</td><td>Streamlined, Optimized, Automated, Reduced, Eliminated, Simplified</td></tr>
<tr><td>Creation</td><td>Built, Designed, Developed, Launched, Created, Established</td></tr>
<tr><td>Analysis</td><td>Analyzed, Identified, Discovered, Evaluated, Assessed, Measured</td></tr>
</table>
