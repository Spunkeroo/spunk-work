<h1>Freelance Contract Template & Guide 2026 (Protect Yourself)</h1>
<p style="color:#666">Updated February 27, 2026 &middot; 15 min read</p>

<p>72% of freelancers who've been stiffed on payment didn't have a signed contract. A solid contract protects your money, your work, and your sanity. This guide covers every clause you need, explains them in plain English, and gives you a <strong>copy-paste template</strong> you can customize in minutes.</p>

<p>This is not legal advice — it's practical guidance from real freelance experience. For contracts over $10,000, get a lawyer to review your specific agreement.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why Every Freelancer Needs a Contract</h2>
<p>A freelance contract is not about distrust — it's about clarity. Both you and the client benefit when expectations are written down.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Without a contract, you risk:</strong> Non-payment for completed work. Unlimited revisions with no extra pay. Clients claiming ownership of work they haven't paid for. Scope expanding with no budget increase. No legal recourse if things go wrong.</div>

<table>
<tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Without Contract</th><th>With Contract</th></tr>
<tr><td>Client doesn't pay</td><td>No legal leverage</td><td>Enforceable payment terms + late fees</td></tr>
<tr><td>Client wants 20 revisions</td><td>You eat the cost</td><td>Contract limits revisions to 2-3 rounds</td></tr>
<tr><td>Client adds extra features</td><td>Free work expected</td><td>Change order process with additional billing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Project cancelled midway</td><td>You lose everything</td><td>Kill fee covers your time and costs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Client uses work without paying</td><td>Hard to enforce</td><td>IP transfers only upon final payment</td></tr>
</table>

<h2 id="clauses">Must-Have Clauses (Explained)</h2>
<p>Every freelance contract needs these 10 clauses. Skip any one and you're leaving yourself exposed.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>1. Scope of Work (SOW).</strong> The most important section. List every deliverable, feature, and specification. Be specific — "website design" is vague, "5-page responsive website with homepage, about, services, portfolio, and contact pages using WordPress" is clear. If it's not in the SOW, it's not included.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>2. Payment Terms.</strong> Total project cost, payment schedule (50% upfront is standard), accepted payment methods, currency, and due dates. Include late payment penalties (1.5%/month is standard).</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>3. Timeline & Milestones.</strong> Start date, milestone dates, and final delivery date. Include a clause that timelines extend if the client is slow to provide feedback or materials.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>4. Revision Limits.</strong> Specify how many rounds of revisions are included (2-3 is standard) and the cost for additional revisions. Define what counts as a "revision" vs. a "new request."</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>5. IP Ownership & Transfer.</strong> State clearly: you own all work until final payment is received. Upon payment, IP transfers to the client. This is your biggest leverage against non-payment.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>6. Kill Fee / Cancellation.</strong> If the client cancels the project, what do you keep? Standard: all payments made + 25-50% of remaining balance. This protects your time, opportunity cost, and turned-down work.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>7. Termination Clause.</strong> How either party can end the agreement. Standard: 14-30 days written notice. Outline what happens to work-in-progress and final payments.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>8. Confidentiality (NDA).</strong> Both parties agree not to share confidential business information. Keep this mutual — the client shouldn't share your rates with others either.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>9. Liability Limitation.</strong> Cap your liability at the total contract value. You should not be liable for indirect damages, lost profits, or consequential damages from your work.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>10. Dispute Resolution.</strong> How disputes are handled: mediation first, then arbitration, then litigation. Specify jurisdiction (your state/country, not theirs).</div>

<h2 id="payment">Payment Terms That Protect You</h2>
<p>Payment structure is the difference between getting paid and getting ghosted. Here are the standard models:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Model</th><th>Structure</th><th>Best For</th><th>Risk Level</th></tr>
<tr><td>50/50</td><td>50% upfront, 50% on delivery</td><td>Most projects</td><td>Low</td></tr>
<tr><td>Milestone</td><td>Payment at each milestone</td><td>Large projects ($10K+)</td><td>Low</td></tr>
<tr><td>Monthly retainer</td><td>Fixed monthly payment</td><td>Ongoing work</td><td>Low</td></tr>
<tr><td>100% upfront</td><td>Full payment before work</td><td>Small projects, new clients</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Net 30</td><td>Payment 30 days after delivery</td><td>Enterprise clients</td><td>High</td></tr>
<tr><td>On completion</td><td>100% after delivery</td><td>NEVER do this</td><td>Extreme</td></tr>
</table>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Golden rule:</strong> Never start work without at least a deposit. For new clients, require 50% upfront minimum. For projects under $500, consider requiring 100% upfront. The clients who refuse deposits are the ones who don't pay.</div>

<h3>Late Payment Clause Language</h3>
<p>Include this in every contract:</p>
<div class="step-box"><strong>Sample clause:</strong> "Invoices are due within [14/30] days of receipt. Late payments incur a 1.5% monthly interest charge. Work will be paused on any project with an outstanding balance exceeding 14 days past due. Resumed work begins within 3 business days of payment receipt."</div>

<h2 id="ip">IP Ownership & Work Product</h2>
<p>Intellectual property is where freelancers lose the most money. Get this wrong and a client can use your work without paying for it.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>The correct approach:</strong> You retain all IP rights until final payment is received in full. Upon payment, you assign all rights to the client. This means if a client stiffs you, they cannot legally use your work. Include this explicitly in your contract.</div>

<h3>What About Portfolio Rights?</h3>
<p>Always include a portfolio clause:</p>
<div class="step-box"><strong>Sample clause:</strong> "Freelancer retains the right to display the work in their portfolio, website, and marketing materials for self-promotion purposes, unless the Client requests in writing that the work remain confidential, in which case a reasonable NDA period of [6-12 months] will apply."</div>

<h3>Pre-Existing IP</h3>
<p>If you use frameworks, templates, or code libraries you built before this project, those remain yours:</p>
<div class="step-box"><strong>Sample clause:</strong> "Any pre-existing intellectual property, tools, frameworks, or materials owned by the Freelancer prior to this engagement remain the Freelancer's property. The Client receives a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use such materials as part of the delivered work product."</div>

<h2 id="scope">Scope Creep Protection</h2>
<p>Scope creep is the number one profit killer for freelancers. Your contract is your first line of defense.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Define "in scope" precisely.</strong> List every deliverable with specifics. "Logo design" becomes "One primary logo design, one alternate layout, delivered in AI, PNG, SVG, and PDF formats at 3 size variants." Leave no room for interpretation.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Create a change order process.</strong> Any work outside the SOW requires a written change order with: description of new work, additional cost, revised timeline, and both parties' approval before work begins.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Sample change order clause:</strong> "Any work not explicitly listed in the Scope of Work constitutes a change order. Change orders must be submitted in writing, approved by both parties, and include an agreed-upon additional fee and revised timeline before work begins. Verbal requests for additional work will not be honored."</div>

<h2 id="kill-fee">Kill Fees & Termination</h2>
<p>Kill fees protect you when a client cancels a project you've already committed time and turned down other work for.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Cancellation Timing</th><th>Standard Kill Fee</th><th>You Keep</th></tr>
<tr><td>Before work starts</td><td>Deposit (non-refundable)</td><td>25-50% of total</td></tr>
<tr><td>During Phase 1</td><td>All payments + 25% remaining</td><td>50-75% of total</td></tr>
<tr><td>During Phase 2+</td><td>All payments + 50% remaining</td><td>75-100% of total</td></tr>
<tr><td>After final delivery</td><td>Full payment due</td><td>100%</td></tr>
</table>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Sample termination clause:</strong> "Either party may terminate this agreement with 14 days' written notice. Upon termination: (a) Client pays for all work completed through the termination date; (b) a kill fee of 25% of the remaining contract balance applies to compensate for opportunity cost; (c) all completed deliverables are transferred upon receipt of final payment."</div>

<h2 id="template">Full Contract Template (Copy-Paste)</h2>
<p>Here's a complete freelance contract template. Customize the bracketed sections for each client.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>FREELANCE SERVICES AGREEMENT</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Date:</strong> [Date]<br>
<strong>Freelancer:</strong> [Your full legal name/business name]<br>
<strong>Client:</strong> [Client's full legal name/business name]<br>
<strong>Project:</strong> [Project name]

<br><br>
<strong>4. REVISIONS</strong><br>
[2-3] rounds of revisions are included. Each additional revision round: $[Amount]. A "revision" modifies existing approved concepts. New concepts or directions constitute a change order.
<br><br>
<strong>5. CHANGE ORDERS</strong><br>

<br><br>
<strong>6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</strong><br>

<h2 id="mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Mistake 1: Using the client's contract without reading it.</strong> Clients' contracts protect them, not you. Always read every word. Negotiate terms you disagree with. If they won't budge on payment terms or IP, walk away.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Mistake 2: Vague scope of work.</strong> "Build a website" means different things to you and the client. Spell out every page, feature, integration, and deliverable format. Ambiguity always costs the freelancer.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Mistake 3: No revision limits.</strong> "Unlimited revisions" sounds client-friendly but destroys your profitability. Two to three rounds is standard and reasonable. Define what counts as a revision vs. a new direction.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Mistake 4: Starting work before the contract is signed.</strong> "We'll sort out the paperwork later" is a red flag. No signature, no work. Period. The contract protects both parties — any reasonable client understands this.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Mistake 5: No kill fee clause.</strong> Projects get cancelled. If you've turned down other work and blocked your calendar, you deserve compensation. A 25-50% kill fee on the remaining balance is standard and fair.</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2 style="margin-top:0" id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<details><summary>Do I need a lawyer to create a freelance contract?</summary><p>For most projects under $10,000, a well-crafted template (like the one above) is sufficient. For larger contracts, retainer agreements, or complex IP situations, invest $300-$500 in a lawyer's review. Many business attorneys offer flat-rate contract reviews.</p></details>
<details><summary>What if a client refuses to sign a contract?</summary><p>Do not work with them. A client who refuses a fair contract is telling you they don't want to be held accountable. This is the biggest red flag in freelancing. Walk away — you'll save yourself thousands in unpaid invoices.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can I use the same contract for every project?</summary><p>Use the same base template but customize the Scope of Work, payment terms, and timeline for each project. The legal clauses (IP, liability, termination, confidentiality) can stay consistent. Update your template annually as laws and best practices evolve.</p></details>
