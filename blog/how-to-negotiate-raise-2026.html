<h1>How to Negotiate a Raise at Work: Complete Guide</h1>
<p style="color:#666">Updated February 27, 2026 &middot; 12 min read</p>

<p>Seventy percent of workers who ask for a raise get one. Yet only 37% of employees ever ask. That gap represents billions of dollars in unclaimed compensation every year. If you have been doing good work and haven't negotiated your salary recently, you are almost certainly leaving money on the table.</p>

<p>This guide gives you the exact framework, scripts, and strategies to negotiate a raise successfully. We cover when to ask, how to prepare, what to say, and how to handle every possible response.</p>

<h2 id="when">When to Ask for a Raise</h2>
<p>Timing affects your success rate more than your argument. Asking at the right moment can mean the difference between an enthusiastic yes and a sympathetic no.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Best timing:</strong> 1-2 months before your company's annual budget planning cycle. This is when managers allocate compensation budgets. If you ask after the budget is set, your manager may agree you deserve a raise but have no money to give you.</div>

<h3>Green Light Moments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>After a major win:</strong> You closed a big deal, launched a successful project, or exceeded quarterly targets. Your value is fresh in everyone's mind.</li>
<li><strong>After taking on new responsibilities:</strong> You absorbed a departing colleague's work, got promoted without a pay bump, or your role has expanded significantly.</li>
<li><strong>During performance reviews:</strong> This is the expected venue for compensation discussions. Come prepared with data.</li>
<li><strong>After a strong quarter or year:</strong> When the company is performing well, budgets are more flexible.</li>
<li><strong>When you have been in the role 12+ months:</strong> Most companies expect at least a year before raise discussions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Red Light Moments</h3>
<ul>
<li>During company layoffs or hiring freezes</li>
<li>When your manager is under extreme pressure</li>
<li>Right after a performance issue or missed target</li>
<li>During major organizational changes or restructuring</li>
<li>Within 3 months of your last raise</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research">Research Your Market Value</h2>
<p>You cannot negotiate effectively without knowing what the market pays for your role. Research is the foundation of every successful raise conversation.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 1: Check salary databases.</strong> Use Glassdoor, Levels.fyi (for tech), Payscale, LinkedIn Salary Insights, and Salary.com. Search for your exact job title, location, experience level, and company size. Collect 3-5 data points and identify the median.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 2: Talk to recruiters.</strong> Accept screening calls from recruiters on LinkedIn. Ask what salary range they are seeing for your role. Recruiters know current market rates better than anyone because they negotiate compensation daily.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 3: Ask peers (carefully).</strong> Professional communities, Slack groups, and industry networks often have salary sharing channels. Blind (for tech workers) and industry-specific subreddits share compensation data openly.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 4: Check job postings.</strong> Many states now require salary ranges on job postings. Search for your title on LinkedIn and Indeed and note the ranges. If your current pay falls below the posted range for similar roles, you have strong evidence for a market adjustment.</div>

<h2 id="build-case">Build Your Case</h2>
<p>Your raise request should feel like a business proposal, not a personal plea. Build a case based on three pillars: your contributions, your market value, and your future potential.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Document your wins:</strong> Create a list of your top 5-10 achievements from the past 12 months. For each, include the specific result and, ideally, a number. "Reduced customer churn by 18%" is stronger than "improved customer retention." Revenue generated, costs saved, efficiency gained, and problems solved are your strongest arguments.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Quantify your value:</strong> Calculate the dollar impact of your contributions wherever possible. If you managed a $500K project that came in on time and under budget, say so. If your marketing campaign generated $2M in pipeline, that is your proof of value. Managers who can justify raises with numbers to their leadership get them approved faster.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Show expanded scope:</strong> If your role has grown beyond your original job description, document the expansion. List the additional responsibilities, team members you now manage, and new skills you have developed. An expanded role without expanded pay is the strongest case for a raise.</div>

<h2 id="script">The Conversation Script</h2>
<p>Schedule a dedicated meeting with your manager. Do not surprise them -- send a brief message: "I'd like to schedule 20 minutes to discuss my compensation. When works for you this week?" This signals that you are serious and gives them time to prepare.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Opening:</strong> "Thank you for taking the time. I want to discuss my compensation because I believe my contributions and the current market warrant an adjustment. I have prepared some data I'd like to share."</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Present your case:</strong> "Over the past [X months/year], I have [achievement 1], [achievement 2], and [achievement 3]. These contributions resulted in [quantified impact]. My role has also expanded to include [additional responsibilities]. Based on market research from Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and industry data, the market rate for my role and experience is [$X-$Y], and my current compensation of [$current] falls below that range."</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Make the ask:</strong> "Based on my performance and market data, I believe a salary of [$target] is appropriate. This represents a [X%] adjustment and aligns with the value I am delivering. I am committed to continuing to drive results for the team."</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Key principle:</strong> State your number confidently and then stop talking. The instinct to fill silence with justifications weakens your position. State your case, make your ask, and wait for their response.</div>

<h2 id="objections">Handling Objections</h2>
<p>Managers will not always say yes immediately. Here is how to handle common responses:</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>"The budget is tight right now."</strong> Response: "I understand. Can we agree on a specific date to revisit this? I'd also like to discuss what milestones would help make this happen in the next review cycle."</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>"You're already at the top of the band."</strong> Response: "I appreciate that context. Given that my role has expanded beyond the original scope, would a title change with a new compensation band be appropriate? My responsibilities now align more with [higher role]."</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>"I need to check with leadership."</strong> Response: "Of course. Would it help if I sent a summary of the data I've shared today? I want to make it easy for you to advocate for this. When can I expect to hear back?"</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>"You haven't been here long enough."</strong> Response: "I understand the typical timeline. However, my contributions have accelerated ahead of that timeline -- [specific examples]. Can we discuss a performance-based adjustment that acknowledges this early impact?"</div>

<h2 id="alternatives">If the Answer Is No</h2>
<p>A no today does not mean no forever. It means you need a different approach.</p>

<h3>Negotiate Non-Salary Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote work flexibility:</strong> Worth $5,000-$15,000/year in saved commuting, childcare, and food costs</li>
<li><strong>Additional PTO:</strong> Even 5 extra days has real dollar value</li>
<li><strong>Professional development budget:</strong> Conferences, courses, certifications ($2,000-$5,000/year)</li>
<li><strong>Title upgrade:</strong> Better titles lead to higher offers at your next role</li>
<li><strong>One-time bonus:</strong> Easier to approve than permanent salary increases</li>
<li><strong>Equity or stock options:</strong> Especially valuable at growth-stage companies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Set a Clear Timeline</h3>
<p>Ask: "What specific goals would I need to achieve for us to revisit this in 3 months?" Get the answer in writing (email summary after the meeting). This creates accountability and a clear path forward.</p>

<h2 id="mistakes">Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Making it personal:</strong> "I need more money because rent went up" is not a business argument. Focus on your value, not your expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Threatening to leave:</strong> Unless you have a real offer and are genuinely willing to walk, threats damage trust and relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Comparing to colleagues:</strong> "John makes more than me" creates awkwardness and violates confidentiality norms. Use market data instead.</li>
<li><strong>Accepting the first counter:</strong> If they counter lower than your ask, it is acceptable to negotiate. "I appreciate the offer of X%. Given the data we discussed, could we meet at Y%?"</li>
<li><strong>Not preparing:</strong> Walking in without data, achievements, and a target number signals that you are not serious.</li>
<li><strong>Asking by email:</strong> Salary negotiations happen in person or video call. Email lacks the personal connection and makes it easier for managers to delay or dismiss.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="follow-up">After the Conversation</h2>

<div class="step-box"><strong>If you got the raise:</strong> Send a thank-you email that confirms the new salary, effective date, and any other agreements. Express your commitment and outline your goals for the next period. Continue performing at the level that earned the raise.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>If you got a timeline:</strong> Send a summary email: "Thank you for the discussion. To confirm, we agreed to revisit my compensation on [date] based on achieving [specific goals]. I will keep you updated on progress." Then hit those goals and follow up on schedule.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>If you got a firm no:</strong> Evaluate whether the role still meets your career and financial goals. If the compensation gap is significant and there is no path to close it, start exploring external opportunities. Having an external offer is the most powerful negotiation tool -- but only use it when you are genuinely ready to leave.</div>
